### ACC Lib - A library for working with Assetto Corsa Competizione Broadcasting and Shared Memory interfaces.

The library was written for my own purposes but because it uses some code from https://github.com/RiddleTime/Race-Element, which in turn uses code from other open source repositories it has to be open source.
Personally I would be happy for you to take the code and do whatever you want with it, but because the aforementioned repo is licensed under GPL-3 this repo has the same restrictions.

I offer no documentation or support and will not accept any pull requests.  The code is provided as is and you use it at your own risk.

I will be publishing the libary as a NuGet package shortly and update this file with details once done.
