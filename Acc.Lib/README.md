### ACC Lib - A library for working with Assetto Corsa Competizione Broadcasting and Shared Memory interfaces.

The library was written for my own purposes but because it uses some code based on code from https://github.com/RiddleTime/Race-Element, which in turn is based on code from other open source repositories it has to be open source.
Personally I would be happy for you to take the code and do whatever you want with it, but because the aforementioned repo is licensed under GPL-3 this repo has the same restrictions.

I offer no documentation or support and will not accept any pull requests.  The code is provided as is and you use it at your own risk.

The libary is available for use in applications as a NuGet package with the ID Acc.Lib and can be installed via Package Manager in Visual Studio or via the .NET CLI using

```
dotnet add Acc.Lib
```
